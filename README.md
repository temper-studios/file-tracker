Git is an actively hostile piece of software. This is the replacement.

Goals:
- Minimal set of commands that make intuitive sense and are easily remembered
- Emphasis on telling the user exactly what is going on and what state they are in at all times. Doesn't hate the user.
- API designed for external tooling, like GUIs.
- Can be used programmatically. Is just a C header. 
- Designed for solo game devs or small teams.

And yes, the irony of using github is not lost on me.
